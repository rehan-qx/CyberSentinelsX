# 🚀 Sentinel-X | Elite Network Security Framework

**Sentinel-X** is a Command & Control C2 with high-performance, automated network exploitation and OSINT framework. It seamlessly orchestrates professional-grade tools like **Bettercap**, **Mitmproxy**, and **Scapy** to perform stealthy interception, SSL stripping, and deep packet analysis through a single, unified Command-Line Interface (CLI).

## 🛡️ Key Modules

| Module | Functionality | Core Engine |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **OSINT Tracker** | Global username search across 60+ platforms. | Requests / Threading |
| **MITM Elite** | Automated ARP Spoofing & Transparent Proxying. | Bettercap + Mitmproxy |
| **Network Discovery** | Real-time ARP mapping & Target Identification. | Scapy |
| **Web Recon** | Fingerprinting, SSL Check, & AI-driven Analysis. | Gemini AI + Requests |
| **Port Scanner** | High-speed multi-threaded TCP port discovery (1-65535). | Socket / ThreadPool |
| **System Monitor** | Host Integrity Audit & Forensic Sanitization. | Windows Kernel API |

## 📸 MITM Workflow

Sentinel-X simplifies complex network attacks into an automated 4-step sequence:

1. **Intelligence**: Auto-scans the LAN to identify active hosts and their MAC addresses.
2. **Diversion**: Manipulates ARP tables and sets up cross-platform NAT rules (iptables/netsh) for transparent routing.
3. **Capture**: Initiates the Mitmproxy engine to intercept and modify high-level HTTP/S traffic.
4. **Exfiltration**: Automatically archives logs and raw flows into the `sentinel_vault/`.

## ✨ Advanced Features

* **AI-Powered Recon**: Integrated with **Google Gemini** to provide real-time security verdicts on target headers and configurations.
* **Safe-Audio Engine**: Intelligent audio detection that automatically bridges WSL2/Linux audio or silences itself if no hardware is found, preventing system crashes.
* **SSLStrip Integration**: Automatically attempts to downgrade HTTPS connections to intercept plaintext data.
* **Cross-Platform Defense**: A dedicated **System Monitor** module for Windows that audits kernel integrity and wipes forensic tracks.
* **Self-Healing Cleanup**: Automatically flushes networking tables and restores IP forwarding on exit to prevent network downtime.

## ⚙️ Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites

Sentinel-X is optimized for **Kali Linux**, **WSL2**, and **Windows**. Ensure you have the following engines installed:

```bash
# For Kali Linux / Ubuntu
sudo apt update && sudo apt install bettercap mitmproxy iptables libasound2-plugins -y

```

### 2. Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies. The framework includes a specialized fix for Windows-to-Linux line endings:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rehan-qx/Cyber-Sentinels-X
cd Cyber-Sentinels-X
pip install -r requirements.txt
bash install.sh
sed -i 's/\r$//' main.py 

```

### 3. Execution

Launch the framework with root privileges (required for network socket manipulation and ARP spoofing):

```bash
sudo python3 main.py

```
